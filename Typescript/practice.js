// let obj = {
//     name : 'chandler'
// }
// console.log(obj.email) really great example of type safety bc in the js file obj.mail will only throw an error when the code is ran in the browser/node while here in typescript, since the email property doesn't exist the error is already thrown 
var user = { name: "chandler", age: 10 };
console.log('chandler');
console.log(user.age);
